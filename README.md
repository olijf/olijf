### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile
Im a software engineer working mostly with csharp / dotnet core. Right now im getting into Blazor, its very nice to work with without know much about web dev stuff.
On the side I work with docker, gitlab, gitlab CI/CD and of course github. I mostly work with Linux (ubuntu that is) and still have a Windows 10 desktop to play video games.
You can contact me on telegram: https://t.me/olafvanderkruk or via linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/olaf-vanderkruk
