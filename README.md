### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my Github profile!
I'm a cyber security researcher/software engineer. Right now I am getting into software defined radios (SDR), so I can use those for my master's thesis.
I run most of my project on Debian, so if you have any issues getting things up and running try that.

You can contact me on [telegram](https://t.me/olafvanderkruk) or via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olaf-vanderkruk)

Im a software engineer working mostly with csharp / dotnet core. Right now im getting into Blazor, its very nice to work with without know much about web dev stuff.
On the side I work with docker, gitlab, gitlab CI/CD and of course github. I mostly work with Linux (ubuntu that is) and still have a Windows 10 desktop to play video games.
